= drive_square.cpp
    - implementation of drive_square, which you'll use to test your odometry and motion controller.
    - you don't need to edit this program, but might find it useful to see how to send commands
      to the motion_controller.

= maebot_channels.h
    - definition of input and output messages used by all programs that run on the Maebot
    
= maebot_driver.c
    - implementation of maebot_driver that talks with the bottom board to send commands to the motors
      and read various internal information
    - you won't need to edit this file, but understanding how communication occurs between the two
      boards is useful.
      
= motion_controller.cpp
    - definition of the motion_controller program for the Maebot.
    - you will implement your PID controller for Task 2 here.
    
= odometry.cpp
    - defintion of the odometry program for the Maebot.
    - you will implement your odometry and gyrodometry for Task 1 here.
    
= rplidar.h and rplidar.c
    - implementation of the driver for talking to the rplidar.
    - you won't need to edit this file, but understanding how communication occurs with the rplidar
      is useful.
      
= rplidar_driver.c
    - implementation of rplidar_driver, which triggers Maebot-specific hardware for using the rplidar
      and then turns on the rplidar and runs forever.
